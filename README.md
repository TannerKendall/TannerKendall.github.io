Superhero Sightings; Java, HTML&CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Spring Boot -- 
Utilized Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, alongside Java to create a full stack Java web app. 
I've also used HTML&CSS and JavaScript for the UI. The user is able to create superhero and supervillain organizations comprised of many heroes or villains, and they're associated superpowers.
The application also allows users to report and view sightings either by form, or via a Google Maps API.

DVD Libraries; Java, JavaScript --
 1. DVD Library Java Console App - A CRUD console application developed using the MVC pattern that 
 allows users to interact with a virtual DVD Library.
 Users can view, add, edit, and delete DVD objects that are written to, and read from a local file.
 2. DVD Library Web App - Created a web page that interacts with an externally hosted DVD Library REST Service using JavaScript and
 jQuery Ajax requests. The webpage is designed using HTML & CSS and allows the user to view library, 
 add a DVD, view DVD info,
 edit a DVD, and delete a DVD.
 
 Vending Machines; Java / HTML, CSS, JavaScript --
-Vending Machine Web App - Created a web page that interacts with an externally hosted Vending Machine REST Service using JavaScript and jQuery Ajax requests. 
The webpage is designed using HTML & CSS and allows the user to view available items, add money, select item for purchase, purchase item, and receive change.
-Vending Machine Java Console App - Another console CRUD application, this one is modeled after a Vending Machine. 
Full JUnit testing suite. Inventory is persisted, and transactions audited through local files.

Guess The Number; Java, RESTful development, JSON --
Developed a REST server to facilitate the user playing a number guessing game 
called “Bulls & Cows” through Postman. Employed a JSON parser to allow the user 
to guess with any number of leading “0’s”. All games and their rounds are stored 
in an external database created in MySQL Workbench.

Flooring Mastery; Java --
A CRUD console application following MVC pattern for a fictional flooring company. The program utilizies Spring Dependency Injection, and allows users to
display, add, edit, and remove orders. The data is stored and audited in external files.

Hotel Reservation Database; SQL --
A SQL database schema and creation script for a theoretical hotel. Sample data and queries are included as well.
